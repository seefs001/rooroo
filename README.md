# 🚀 rooroo (如如): Minimalist AI Orchestration with Specialist Agents 🚀

**Version: v0.5.6** | [Changelog](changelog.md) | [v0.5.0 Details](v0.5.0.md) | [v0.4.0 Details](v0.4.0.md) | [v0.3.0 Details](v0.3.0.md) | [v0.2.0 Details](v0.2.0.md) | [v0.1.0 Details](v0.1.0.md)

`rooroo` provides **minimalist AI orchestration** for software development using **specialist Rooroo agents** within VS Code via the [Roo Code extension](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code). It employs a lean, coordinated team with distinct planning and execution phases, driven by a **`Rooroo Navigator`-led, Output Envelope-based workflow**. Task management relies on `.rooroo/queue.jsonl`, event logging on `.rooroo/logs/activity.jsonl` (now with event severity), detailed task briefings are provided in `.rooroo/tasks/TASK_ID/context.md`, and agent-produced artifacts are stored directly in `.rooroo/tasks/TASK_ID/`. All file paths are relative to the VS Code workspace root, with Rooroo internal files prefixed by `.rooroo/`.

## 🤔 What's in a Name? The Meaning of "rooroo (如如)"

The name "rooroo" comes from the term **"如如" (rú rú)** found in Buddhist philosophy. It relates to the concept of **Tathātā**, often translated as "Thusness" or "Suchness."

![img](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQeUmsB4LIHLErFEbei5g8PfIFG-XQntgqLyA&s)

* **Thusness/Suchness (真如):** Refers to the fundamental, unchanging, true nature of all phenomena – reality as it is.
* **Equality & Non-Duality (不二平等):** Implies that, at the ultimate level, all things share this same essential nature.
* **Emphasis:** The repetition "如如" emphasizes that this inherent "thusness" is pervasive across *all* things.

In the context of this project, the name evokes the idea of an underlying, consistent nature guiding the orchestration. This philosophy informs the **minimalist approach**, focusing on the essential 'thusness' of each agent's specialized role.


## ✨ Key Principles

*   **Minimalism & Specialization:** A small team of Rooroo agents with clear roles, leveraging appropriate LLM tiers. Adherence to the unified workspace-relative path handling system ensures clarity in file operations: all paths are relative to the VS Code workspace root, and Rooroo internal files are prefixed by `.rooroo/`.
*   **Navigator-Led Orchestration:** An efficient, interactive workflow where the **🧭 Rooroo Navigator (Master Project Orchestrator & Sentinel)** serves as the primary user interface and central coordinator, embodying principles like "Evidence-Based Operation," "Proactive Logging," "Resilience," "Project Integrity," and acting as a "Guardian of Protocol." It also follows the **Principle of Least Assumption**, refusing to guess or make assumptions when faced with ambiguity. It engages the `rooroo-planner` for complex work, dispatches tasks from `.rooroo/queue.jsonl` (paths within are workspace-relative), processes agent responses (structured JSON "Output Envelopes" which must be strictly parsable, now with explicit handling of `error_details`), logs events with severity levels to `.rooroo/logs/activity.jsonl` (paths within are workspace-relative) using its enhanced `SafeLogEvent` procedure, and guides the user through decisions and failures, utilizing a `HandleCriticalErrorOrHalt` protocol for unrecoverable issues. The Navigator employs detailed internal `<thinking>` blocks to manage its complex logic (such as queue parsing, variable state management, and message construction for experts) while maintaining concise user-facing communication. All path references in its operations and instructions adhere to the workspace-relative path convention.
*   **Planner-Managed Queue & Context:** The `rooroo-planner` (Master Strategist) has sole authority over creating planned tasks for `.rooroo/queue.jsonl` and creates detailed task briefings in `.rooroo/tasks/TASK_ID/context.md` for each sub-task. These contexts and goals clearly use workspace-relative paths for both user project files and Rooroo artifact paths (which start with `.rooroo/` and point directly to artifacts in other task folders, e.g., `.rooroo/tasks/PREVIOUS_TASK_ID/artifact.ext`). The Planner emphasizes clear expert assignment and actionable sub-task goals, adhering to the **Concise Context File Preparation** guideline (preferring Markdown links over embedding large content).
*   **Output Envelope-Based Communication:** Agents report status, results (including `error_details` where applicable), or ask questions by returning a structured, strictly parsable JSON string "Output Envelope" directly to the `Rooroo Navigator`. All paths within these envelopes are workspace-relative, with Rooroo artifacts referenced by their direct paths within `.rooroo/tasks/TASK_ID/`.
*   **Structured Artifacts:** All task-related files (context briefings, agent-produced artifacts) are organized within a clear `.rooroo/tasks/TASK_ID/` structure, with paths being workspace-relative.
*   **Concise Context File Preparation:** When preparing `context.md` files (Navigator for temp/planner tasks, Planner for sub-tasks), agents **prefer linking** to existing code, large documents, or complex data using Markdown (e.g., `Relevant code: [src/module.py](src/module.py)`) rather than embedding full content. Small, critical snippets are acceptable if essential for immediate understanding, but full file embedding should be avoided to keep contexts concise.
*   **Consistent Task IDs:** All tasks use the `ROO#` prefix (e.g., `ROO#PLAN_...`, `ROO#TEMP_...`, `ROO#SUB_...`) for unique identification throughout the system.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Targeted use of Smart vs. Cheap LLMs per role.
*   **Structured Workflow:** Defined roles, artifacts, communication protocols, and line-oriented data files promote clarity and robustness.
*   **Principle of Least Assumption:** When faced with ambiguity regarding user intent, required expert selection, file paths, or next steps, agents will **not guess or make assumptions**. Instead, they explicitly ask for clarification, ensuring operations are based on clear understanding rather than potentially incorrect assumptions.

## 🚀 Get Started & Core Workflow

Follow these steps to use the `rooroo` agent team (v0.5.6+):

1.  **Install Roo Code:** Ensure the [Roo Code VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RooVeterinaryInc.roo-cline) is installed.
2.  **Load Modes:** Ensure your `.roomodes` file (v0.5.6 compatible, defining the `rooroo-...` agents) is in your workspace root.
3.  **Reload VS Code:** Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` -> "Developer: Reload Window".
4.  **(Optional) Brainstorming:** Activate **💡 Rooroo Idea Sparker** in Roo Code chat for interactive ideation. It can save summaries to `.rooroo/brainstorming/` or as artifacts within a task (`.rooroo/tasks/TASK_ID/rooroo-idea-sparker_summary.md`) if directed by the `Rooroo Navigator` or `rooroo-planner` as part of a task.
5.  **Activate Navigator:** Select **🧭 Rooroo Navigator** in Roo Code chat.
6.  **State Your Goal:** Describe your project or task to the Navigator.
7.  **Navigator Triage & Planner Engagement:**
    *   The `Rooroo Navigator` analyzes your request, applying the **Principle of Least Assumption**. It understands that all file references use workspace-relative paths. It utilizes extensive internal `<thinking>` blocks to process information and decide on next steps, ensuring concise communication.
    *   *Complex Goal/New Project/Significant Change/Uncertainty:* If the goal requires multi-expert orchestration, has complex dependencies, or if the Navigator is uncertain about the best single-expert path, it informs you and delegates to the **🗓️ Rooroo Planner**. It invokes the Planner using `new_task` with a `ROO#PLAN_` task ID and a workspace-relative path to a `context.md` (e.g., `.rooroo/tasks/ROO#PLAN_.../context.md`) it creates, following the **Concise Context File Preparation** guideline (preferring links).
    *   The `rooroo-planner` analyzes the request, plans sub-tasks, assigns `ROO#SUB_` IDs, creates `.rooroo/tasks/SUB_TASK_ID/context.md` files (workspace-relative path, following concise context guidelines), and generates an overview. The planner assigns the appropriate expert (`rooroo-developer`, `rooroo-analyzer`, or `rooroo-documenter`) for each sub-task's `suggested_mode`.
    *   The Planner returns its `PlannerOutput` JSON envelope to the Navigator.
    *   The Navigator processes this envelope, adds sub-tasks to `.rooroo/queue.jsonl`, logs the event, and informs you.
    *   *Simple, High-Certainty Single-Expert Task (Developer, Analyzer, Documenter only):* If the Navigator identifies a **clear, simple task** for **specifically `rooroo-developer`, `rooroo-analyzer`, or `rooroo-documenter`** with high confidence and the user implies immediate execution, it may create a `ROO#TEMP_` task, write its `context.md` (following concise context rules), and dispatch it directly to that expert. **If the required expert is not one of these three, or if there's ambiguity, it will ask for clarification or delegate to the Planner.**
    *   *Queue Single-Expert Task (Developer, Analyzer, Documenter only):* If a simple task for one of the allowed experts (`developer`, `analyzer`, `documenter`) is identified but queuing is more appropriate (e.g., user wants to backlog it), the Navigator creates the task, context, logs it, and adds it to the queue.
    *   *Ambiguous Request:* If the user's goal or required expert is unclear, the Navigator will ask for clarification using `ask_followup_question`.
8.  **Navigator Executes Plan (Queue Driven & Envelope Driven):**
    *   The `Rooroo Navigator` reads the top task from `.rooroo/queue.jsonl`. It verifies the `suggested_mode` is valid (`rooroo-developer`, `rooroo-analyzer`, or `rooroo-documenter`). This processing is managed internally within `<thinking>` blocks.
    *   If the queue is empty, it informs you and awaits further instruction (Phase 4).
    *   It prepares a message for the designated expert (as per `suggested_mode`), including the `ROO#` `taskId`, `context_file_path` (workspace-relative), and `goal_for_expert`.
    *   It invokes the expert agent using `new_task`.
    *   The expert agent executes the task, reading its briefing from the `context.md` file. When accessing user project files or Rooroo artifacts, it uses workspace-relative paths. It creates Rooroo-generated artifacts directly in its task folder: `.rooroo/tasks/TASK_ID/`.
    *   **Crucially:** Upon completion, failure, or needing clarification, the agent returns its entire output as a structured, strictly parsable JSON **Output Envelope** directly to the Navigator. Output artifact paths are workspace-relative.
9.  **Result Processing & Iteration (Navigator - Phase 3 of its logic):**
    *   The `Rooroo Navigator` receives and parses the expert's JSON Output Envelope. This parsing and the subsequent logic are managed within internal `<thinking>` blocks.
    *   **If `status` is `"NeedsClarification"`:**
        *   The Navigator presents the agent's question to you using `ask_followup_question`.
        *   Your response is relayed back to the expert agent for resumption.
    *   **If `status` is `"Done"` or `"Failed"`:**
        *   The Navigator logs the event using `SafeLogEvent`.
        *   It updates `.rooroo/queue.jsonl` by removing the processed task.
        *   It informs you of the outcome, linking artifacts.
        *   **Handling Failures:** If status is `"Failed"`, the Navigator informs you and moves to Phase 4 for a decision.
    *   If the queue has more tasks and the previous task was `"Done"`, the cycle repeats (Navigator proceeds to Phase 2).
10. **Review Artifacts:** Monitor progress via `.rooroo/` subdirectories, `.rooroo/queue.jsonl`, and `.rooroo/logs/activity.jsonl`. Rooroo-generated artifacts are found directly in `.rooroo/tasks/TASK_ID/`.

## 🤖 The Agent Team & Cost Optimization

`rooroo` v0.5.6 uses specialized Rooroo agents. All agents operate under their directives, emphasizing the **Principle of Least Assumption** and **Concise Context File Preparation**. This allows for cost optimization by assigning appropriate LLM tiers.

*   **🧭 Rooroo Navigator (⚡ Cheap/Fast Recommended):** Your primary interface and project guide, embodying principles like "Evidence-Based Operation," "Proactive Logging," "Resilience," and acting as a "Guardian of Protocol." Critically, it adheres to the **Principle of Least Assumption**, asking for clarification instead of guessing. Manages user interaction with a direct, formal style. Triages requests using structured logic: delegates complex or uncertain work to `rooroo-planner`; handles simple, high-certainty tasks *only* for `rooroo-developer`, `rooroo-analyzer`, or `rooroo-documenter` directly or via queue (asking for clarification otherwise); asks for clarification on ambiguous goals. Dispatches tasks from `.rooroo/queue.jsonl` (validating `suggested_mode`). Processes agent JSON "Output Envelope" responses. Logs events with severity to `.rooroo/logs/activity.jsonl`. Handles user decisions, especially for failures or ambiguities. Uses internal `<thinking>` blocks for complex logic while maintaining concise user communication. Enforces workspace-relative paths and **Concise Context File Preparation** (preferring links) when creating contexts.
*   **🗓️ Rooroo Planner (🧠 Smart/Expensive Recommended):** Receives directives from the Navigator. As a "Master Strategist," it decomposes complex goals, emphasizing optimal Rooroo expert assignment (`rooroo-developer`, `rooroo-analyzer`, or `rooroo-documenter`). Creates detailed context Markdown files for sub-tasks in `.rooroo/tasks/SUB_TASK_ID/context.md`, following the **Concise Context File Preparation** guideline (preferring Markdown links over embedding large content). Reports back via a JSON `PlannerOutput` envelope containing `queue_tasks_json_lines` (with workspace-relative paths).
*   **🧑‍💻 Rooroo Developer (Custom / Varies):** Receives `ROO#` task ID, `context_file_path` (workspace-relative), and `goal` from the Navigator. As an "Engineering Virtuoso," executes coding tasks based on its `context.md`. Accesses user project files and Rooroo artifacts using workspace-relative paths. Rooroo-generated artifacts are stored directly in `.rooroo/tasks/TASK_ID/` or modifies project files. Reports back via a JSON Output Envelope. Adheres to the **Principle of Least Assumption** if context/goal is unclear, asking for clarification.
*   **📊 Rooroo Analyzer (Insightful Investigator) (⚡ Cheap/Fast Recommended):** Receives `ROO#` task ID, `context_file_path` (workspace-relative), and `goal`. As an "Insightful Investigator," performs analysis based on `context.md`, accessing data/code via workspace-relative paths. Generates reports directly in `.rooroo/tasks/TASK_ID/`. Reports back via a JSON Output Envelope. Adheres to the **Principle of Least Assumption**, asking for clarification if goal/context is ambiguous.
*   **✍️ Rooroo Documenter (⚡ Cheap/Fast Recommended):** Receives `ROO#` task ID, `context_file_path` (workspace-relative), and `goal`. As a "Clarity Craftsman," creates/updates documentation based on `context.md`, accessing files via workspace-relative paths. New Rooroo-generated documents are stored directly in `.rooroo/tasks/TASK_ID/`. Reports back via a JSON Output Envelope. Adheres to the **Principle of Least Assumption**, asking for clarification if goal/context is unclear.
*   **💡 Rooroo Idea Sparker (🧠 Smart/Expensive Recommended):** Can be invoked interactively or tasked. As an "Innovation Catalyst," facilitates brainstorming. When accessing user project files for context, uses workspace-relative paths. Summaries saved to `.rooroo/brainstorming/` or as task artifacts in `.rooroo/tasks/TASK_ID/`. Reports back via a JSON Output Envelope when tasked. Adheres to the **Principle of Least Assumption**, asking for clarification if the brainstorming topic is vague.

*Note: The roles of Solution Architect, UX Specialist, and Guardian Validator from previous versions are implicitly covered by the capabilities of the Rooroo Planner to define detailed tasks and the Rooroo Developer/Analyzer/Documenter to execute specialized aspects. If more distinct specialist roles are needed, new Rooroo agents can be defined following the v0.5.0 patterns.*

*Configure the underlying LLM for each agent mode (if supported) to balance cost and capability.*

## 📊 Core Data Files (v0.5.6)

### `.rooroo/queue.jsonl`

This file contains the ordered list of tasks to be executed. Each line is a JSON object representing one task. The `rooroo-planner` defines sub-tasks, and the `Rooroo Navigator` consumes it and may add `ROO#TEMP_` tasks (for `rooroo-developer`, `rooroo-analyzer`, or `rooroo-documenter` only).

Example task line structure (defined by `rooroo-planner`):
```json
{"taskId": "ROO#SUB_parent_S001_setup_database", "parentTaskId": "ROO#PLAN_project_init_123", "suggested_mode": "rooroo-developer", "context_file_path": ".rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_parent_S001_setup_database/context.md", "goal_for_expert": "Set up the initial database schema as per context. Specs linked in context.md."}
```
Example task line structure (defined by `Rooroo Navigator` for `ROO#TEMP_` task):
```json
{"taskId": "ROO#TEMP_20240101130000_update_readme", "suggested_mode": "rooroo-documenter", "context_file_path": ".rooroo/tasks/ROO#TEMP_20240101130000_update_readme/context.md", "goal_for_expert": "Update the README.md (link in context.md) with latest version."}
```
Key fields per task object:
*   `taskId`: Unique identifier (`ROO#...` format).
*   `parentTaskId`: (For sub-tasks) ID of the parent planning task.
*   `suggested_mode`: The Rooroo expert mode suggested (`rooroo-developer`, `rooroo-analyzer`, or `rooroo-documenter`).
*   `context_file_path`: Workspace-relative path to the Markdown briefing (e.g., `.rooroo/tasks/TASK_ID/context.md`).
*   `goal_for_expert`: Clear goal, often referencing links within the `context.md`.

### `.rooroo/logs/activity.jsonl`

Append-only file recording key events with severity. Each line is a JSON object written primarily by the `Rooroo Navigator`.

Example log entry structure (simplified):
```json
{"timestamp": "2024-07-25T10:00:05Z", "agent_slug": "rooroo-navigator", "severity": "INFO", "task_id": "ROO#SUB_parent_S001_setup_database", "event_type": "QUEUE_DISPATCH", "details": {"message": "Dispatching to rooroo-developer..."}}

### `.rooroo/tasks/TASK_ID/context.md`

For each task (`ROO#PLAN_`, `ROO#SUB_`, `ROO#TEMP_`), this Markdown file is the comprehensive briefing for the assigned agent. Created by the Planner (for sub-tasks) or Navigator (for planner/temp tasks), following the **Concise Context File Preparation** guideline.

It includes:
*   Detailed description of the goal.
*   Instructions and requirements.
*   Acceptance criteria.
*   **Links** to input artifacts or relevant existing files (all paths workspace-relative, e.g., `[Schema Doc](project_docs/schema.md)`, `[Previous Output](.rooroo/tasks/PREVIOUS_TASK_ID/data.json)`). Small, critical snippets may be embedded if essential.
*   Any other necessary contextual information.

### Output Artifacts

- **Primary Output:** Varies by expert (code, documentation, analysis reports, etc.).
- **Storage Location:** All Rooroo-generated artifacts are stored directly within the task's folder: `.rooroo/tasks/TASK_ID/`.
    - Example: `.rooroo/tasks/ROO#DEV123/output.py`, `.rooroo/tasks/ROO#ANA456/analysis_report.md`.
    - Specific FILENAMING rules may apply (e.g., descriptive names).
- **User Project Files:** Modified/created user files (e.g., `src/my_module.py`) are referenced by workspace-relative paths.
