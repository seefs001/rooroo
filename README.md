# 🚀 rooroo (如如): Minimalist AI Orchestration with Specialist Agents 🚀

**Version: v0.6.2** | [Changelog](changelog.md) | [v0.6.0 Details](v0.6.0.md) | [v0.5.0 Details](v0.5.0.md)

`rooroo` is a **minimalist AI orchestration framework** for VS Code, designed to streamline software development using a team of specialized Rooroo agents. It emphasizes a clear, Navigator-led workflow, efficient task management, and robust communication, all while incorporating advanced prompting techniques for enhanced reliability.

## 🤔 The Philosophy: "rooroo (如如)" - Thusness

Inspired by Buddhist philosophy, "如如" (rú rú) or "Thusness" reflects the idea of an underlying, consistent nature. This informs `rooroo`'s minimalist approach, focusing on the essential, specialized role of each agent.

## ⚙️ Core Principles
*   **Navigator-Led Orchestration:** The **🧭 Rooroo Navigator** is your central guide, managing task flows, user interactions, and expert agent coordination with concise communication.
*   **Specialized Agent Team:** A lean team of focused AI agents:
    *   **🗓️ Rooroo Planner:** Decomposes complex goals.
    *   **🧑‍💻 Rooroo Developer:** Crafts code and UIs.
    *   **📊 Rooroo Analyzer:** Investigates and delivers insights.
    *   **✍️ Rooroo Documenter:** Creates clear documentation.
    *   **💡 Rooroo Idea Sparker:** Facilitates brainstorming.
*   **Structured Workflow & Communication:**
    *   **Task Management:** Uses `.rooroo/queue.jsonl` for pending tasks.
    *   **Detailed Briefings:** Tasks are detailed in `.rooroo/tasks/TASK_ID/context.md`, prioritizing links over embedded content.
    *   **Organized Artifacts:** Outputs are stored in `.rooroo/tasks/TASK_ID/`.
    *   **Clear Reporting:** Agents use a structured JSON "Output Envelope" to report to the Navigator.
    *   **Event Logging:** Key events are logged with severity in `.rooroo/logs/activity.jsonl`.
*   **Key Operational Guidelines:**
    *   **Minimalism & Specialization:** Focused roles for clarity.
    *   **Concise Context (Link, Don't Embed):** Efficient briefings.
    *   **Principle of Least Assumption:** Agents clarify ambiguities, don't guess.
    *   **Consistent Task IDs:** `ROO#` prefixes for easy tracking.
    *   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Uses appropriate LLM tiers per agent.
    *   **Workspace-Relative Paths:** Simplifies file referencing.
    *   **Customizable Agent Behavior (Optional):** Utilize the `.roo/rules/` directory for workspace-wide custom instructions to tailor agent behavior, aligning with Roo Code best practices for organization and potential performance improvements.

## 🚀 Quick Start & Core Workflow

Using `rooroo` involves these main steps:

1.  **Setup:** Install [Roo Code VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RooVeterinaryInc.roo-cline).
    *   Load your `.roomodes` file.
        *   **For Roo Code v3.18.0 and later:** You can use the YAML format for `.roomodes`.
        *   **For Roo Code versions earlier than v3.18.0:** You must use the JSON format for `.roomodes` (e.g., `.roomodes.json`).
    *   Reload VS Code.
    *   (Optional: For advanced customization, create a `.roo/rules/` directory and add custom instruction files to tailor agent behavior across your workspace.)
2.  **Initiate:** Select **🧭 Rooroo Navigator** and state your goal.
3.  **Navigator Triage:** The Navigator assesses your request:
    *   For *complex/uncertain tasks*, it engages the **🗓️ Rooroo Planner** to break it down into sub-tasks with `context.md` briefings. These go into the `.rooroo/queue.jsonl`.
    *   For *simple, clear single-expert tasks* (Developer, Analyzer, Documenter only), it prepares `context.md` and may execute directly or queue the task.
    *   If *ambiguous*, it asks you for clarification.
4.  **Execution:** The Navigator dispatches tasks from the queue to the assigned Rooroo expert. The expert uses its `context.md` and stores outputs in `.rooroo/tasks/TASK_ID/`.
5.  **Reporting:** The expert returns a JSON **Output Envelope** (status, message, artifacts) to the Navigator.
6.  **Processing & Iteration:** The Navigator parses the envelope:
    *   `NeedsClarification`: Relays question to you.
    *   `Done`/`Failed`: Logs event, updates queue, informs you. Auto-proceeds with plans if applicable.
7.  **Monitor:** Track progress via `.rooroo/queue.jsonl` and `.rooroo/logs/activity.jsonl`.

## 🤖 The Agent Team at a Glance

Each Rooroo agent adheres to core principles like the **Principle of Least Assumption** and **Concise Context File Preparation** (linking over embedding).

*   **🧭 Rooroo Navigator (⚡ Cheap/Fast Recommended):** Your primary interface. Manages interactions, triages tasks, dispatches from the queue, processes expert reports, and logs events. Prioritizes concise communication.
*   **🗓️ Rooroo Planner (🧠 Smart/Expensive Recommended):** Decomposes complex goals into sub-tasks for the Developer, Analyzer, or Documenter. Creates their `context.md` briefings and can flag ambiguous expert choices for the Navigator to resolve.
*   **🧑‍💻 Rooroo Developer (Custom / Varies):** Executes coding tasks based on `context.md`. Stores outputs in its task folder or modifies project files.
*   **📊 Rooroo Analyzer (⚡ Cheap/Fast Recommended):** Performs analysis based on `context.md`. Generates reports in its task folder.
*   **✍️ Rooroo Documenter (⚡ Cheap/Fast Recommended):** Creates/updates documentation based on `context.md`. Stores outputs in its task folder.
*   **💡 Rooroo Idea Sparker (🧠 Smart/Expensive Recommended):** Facilitates interactive brainstorming. Summaries can be saved to `.rooroo/brainstorming/` or task folders.

*Balance LLM tiers per agent for optimal cost and capability.*

## 📊 Core Data Files Explained

Key files driving `rooroo` operations:

*   **`.rooroo/queue.jsonl`:** Ordered list of tasks (JSON objects per line).
    *   *Defines:* What needs to be done, by which expert, with what goal and context.
    *   *Example Task:* `{"taskId": "ROO#SUB_...", "suggested_mode": "rooroo-developer", "context_file_path": ".rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_.../context.md", "goal_for_expert": "Build feature X..."}`
*   **`.rooroo/logs/activity.jsonl`:** Append-only log of key events with severity (INFO, ERROR, etc.).
    *   *Tracks:* What actions agents take and their outcomes.
    *   *Example Log:* `{"timestamp": "...", "agent_slug": "rooroo-navigator", "severity": "INFO", "task_id": "ROO#...", "event_type": "EXPERT_REPORT", "details": {"status": "Done"}}`
*   **`.rooroo/tasks/TASK_ID/context.md`:** The comprehensive Markdown briefing for an assigned agent.
    *   *Provides:* Detailed goals, requirements, and **links** to relevant files/artifacts (prioritizing links over embedding content).
*   **Output Artifacts:** Generated by experts (code, reports, docs) are stored directly in their respective task folders: `.rooroo/tasks/TASK_ID/` (e.g., `output.py`, `analysis_report.md`).
